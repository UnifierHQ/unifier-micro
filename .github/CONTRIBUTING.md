## Reporting bugs
If you found a bug, please open a GitHub issue using the **Bug report** template.

  are free to add more details about the bug, this way we can more easily patch bugs.
- If the bug is limited to a specific branch (e.g. main, dev), please say so in the **Additional context** section.

## Suggesting a feature

  are free to add on to the feedback by giving your suggestions on how the feature could be implemented.
- If your feature request is related to a bug in an existing issue (e.g. suggesting a potential solution to a problem),
  please add on to the bug report instead.

## Contributing code
If you wish to contribute your code to the project, please **fork the repository**, add your changes there, then open a 
Pull request.
- If your PR fixes a bug or addresses a feature request, please reference the relevant issues. This way, people (including
  us) can know if we need to do work to fix an issue, or if we just need to merge a PR.
  If your changes are **purely cosmetic**, please don't open a PR, unless the changes **significantly improve** the
  readability of the source code.
