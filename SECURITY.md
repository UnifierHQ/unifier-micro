# Security Policy
At UnifierHQ, we take user safety very seriously. We constantly try to 
implement features that help minimize or eliminate the effects malicious
actors can have on our community. However, we understand we are not 
perfect, and there may be vulnerabilities in our code that may impact 
the safety of hosters and users every now and then.

## Supported Versions
Currently, only the v1.1.x series receives security updates. Preceding
versions have been discontinued and will not be updated any further.
| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.1   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability
When you have found a vulnerability, DO NOT open a bug report. These 
reports will be taken down and may result in sanctions.

Instead, please either DM a developer on Discord, or report the 
vulnerability to us, so we can privately patch the vulnerability.
